			Charles Leclerc is a Monégasque racing driver, currently racing in Formula One for Scuderia Ferrari. 
			Leclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018 for Sauber, a team affiliated with Ferrari, for which he was part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. With Sauber having finished last the year before, Leclerc led the charge to improve its finishing position in the constructors' championship to eighth, and was the higher ranked of the two Sauber drivers. He joined Ferrari the next season and became the second-youngest driver to qualify on pole position in Formula One at the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2019 season also saw Leclerc take his first career win in Belgium. He won the FIA Pole Trophy for most pole positions in the 2019 season, becoming the youngest driver to win it, before winning it again in 2022.

			Leclerc took pole in the season opening Bahrain Grand Prix. He won the Grand Prix, his and Ferrari's first Formula 1 victory since 2019, battling closely with Red Bull driver Max Verstappen throughout the race. His Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. finished second for a Ferrari 1–2. The result meant he and Ferrari took the lead in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championship respectively. In doing so, he led the Formula One World Championship for the first time. After a second-place finish in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Leclerc took a dominant victory in the Australian Grand Prix, achieving his first grand slam in Formula One, and Ferrari's first since the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Leclerc led the race with a large margin until a power unit issue forced his retirement, handing Max Verstappen both the race victory and the World Championship lead. After taking pole position at his home race in the Monaco Grand Prix, Leclerc finished the race in 4th place due to strategical error and a wet track. The next race in Azerbaijan saw Leclerc retire yet again with a power unit failure, which put him at third in the drivers' standings behind Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez. Leclerc started 19th for the Canadian Grand Prix due to a grid penalty for exceeding his allocation for power unit components; he went on to finish the race in fifth.

			At the British Grand Prix, Leclerc finished fourth after losing out on pit strategy to his teammate. Leclerc then took first place at the Austrian Grand Prix. At the French Grand Prix he took pole position before crashing out of the race on lap 18, after making a mistake. At the Hungarian Grand Prix he qualified third behind his teammate but finished the race sixth after a strategic error made by Ferrari to place him on the hard compound tyres, despite other drivers such as Fernando Alonso losing significant lap time on them, Max Verstappen eventually took the win despite qualifying tenth and extended his lead in the Formula One World Championship to Leclerc by 80 points. The Belgian Grand Prix which saw Leclerc start in 15th place. Despite working his way through the grid well he had to pit eventually for mediums due to a tear-off in his brake ducts. The pitstop cost Leclerc a podium finish. At the Dutch Grand Prix, he admitted that he had 'stopped counting' the points deficit to Verstappen. He started 2nd and finished 3rd after losing his second place position to Mercedes' George Russell. Leclerc took pole position at Ferrari's home race in Italy at the Monza Circuit, but due to a team decision from Ferrari to pit under a Virtual safety car, he lost the race lead to Red bull's Max Verstappen and took the checkered flag in second place. Leclerc took pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, he finished in second place to Red Bull's Sergio Pérez who had taken the lead at the first corner.

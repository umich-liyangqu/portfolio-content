		<p>
			Leclerc took pole and won in the season opening Bahrain Grand Prix. Starting the season in a strong note. In doing so, he led the Formula One World Championship for the first time
			After a second-place set back in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Leclerc took a dominant victory in the Australian Grand Prix. But things started to go downhill from here. 
			Constant power unit failure and bad stratgy by the team lost his lead to the Redbull driver, and lost his first chance to a driver champion.
